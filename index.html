    <h2>What Tristan Brings to the Table</h2>
    <p>Tristan has quite a lot of experience with managing and leading clubs and organziations. He is the President of the <a href="https://maumelledebateandspeech.club">Maumelle Debate and Speech Club</a> and is the Secretary, Historian, Co-Treasurer, and Webmaster of the <a href="https://maumelletsa.org">Maumelle Technology Student Association (TSA)</a>. 
    <p>On top of this, he has several additional extracurricular projects with both fellow students and alone. He is the one behind the <a href="https://bio.meecso.com">AP Biology Online Textbook</a> and he has aided in the development of additional websites.

    <h2>The Platform</h2>
    <p>The Tristan Goodell Platform is made up of three main pillars:
        <ul>
            <li>Transparancy Between NHS and the Community
            <li>Increased Fundraising</li>
            <li>More Initiatives</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Transparancy Between NHS and the Community</h3>
    <p>A major issue right now is that the community is simply not aware of NHS' activities and projects. This is a missed opportunity for potential publicity and interest in the club. While NHS has social media pages, NHS lacks vital lines of communication to the community like a website and press kit. 
        <ul>
            <li>An NHS website would allow notes from meetings to be archived, allow officers to write up blog posts, and provide a mthod for sharing information in general with the community.</li> 
            <li>A Press Kit could pave the way for interview with the local media and provide a way for the community to find more information about the club. Press Kits are quite common in the world of non-profits and organizations in general.</li>
        </ul>
   </p>
    <h3>Increased Fundraising</h3>
    <p>Currently, NHS must dedicate 22.12% of its yearly income to renew its official NHS affiliation. A massive fifth of the NHS budget is gobbled up in one expense. This combined with other costs depletes the NHS budget quite quickly. This means that NHS cannot pursue all of the projects it wants. Increased fundraising will pave the way for more flexibility and the freedom to partake in more community service projects. This will increase the footprint of benefit for the local community.</p>
    <h3>More Initiatives</h3>
    <p>A big part of NHS is the initiatives that it pursues. For this year, the main project is of course the NHS Mural. For next year, Tristan wants to lead NHS into even more projects. Potential ideas are creating a central club repository to registery clubs in (since, currently, there is a severe lack of discovery for MHS clubs). This may not only help the community, but also be a potential fundraising opportunity.</p>
